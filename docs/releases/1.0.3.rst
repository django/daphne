1.0.3 Release Notes
===================

Channels 1.0.3 is a minor bugfix release, released on 2017/02/01.

Changes
-------

* Database connections are no longer force-closed after each test is run.

* Channel sessions are not re-saved if they're empty even if they're marked as
  modified, allowing logout to work correctly.

* WebsocketDemultiplexer now correctly does sessions for the second/third/etc.
  connect and disconnect handlers.

* Request reading timeouts now correctly return 408 rather than erroring out.

* The ``rundelay`` delay server now only polls the database once per second,
  and this interval is configurable with the ``--sleep`` option.


Backwards Incompatible Changes

None.
