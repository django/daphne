1.1.0 Release Notes
===================

Channels 1.1.0 introduces a couple of major but backwards-compatible changes,
including most notably the inclusion of a standard, framework-agnostic JavaScript
library for easier integration with your site.


Major Changes
-------------

* Channels now includes a JavaScript wrapper that wraps reconnection and
  multiplexing for you on the client side. For more on how to use it, see the
  :doc:`/javascript` documentation.

* Test classes have been moved from ``channels.tests`` to ``channels.test``
  to better match Django. Old imports from ``channels.tests`` will continue to
  work but will trigger a deprecation warning, and ``channels.tests`` will be
  removed completely in version 1.3.

Minor Changes & Bugfixes
------------------------

* Bindings now support non-integer fields for primary keys on models.

* The ``enforce_ordering`` decorator no longer suffers a race condition where
  it would drop messages under high load.

* ``runserver`` no longer errors if the ``staticfiles`` app is not enabled in Django.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
