1.0.2 Release Notes
===================

Channels 1.0.2 is a minor bugfix release, released on 2017/01/12.

Changes
-------

* Websockets can now be closed from anywhere using the new ``WebsocketCloseException``,
  available as ``channels.exceptions.WebsocketCloseException(code=None)``. There is
  also a generic ``ChannelSocketException`` you can base any exceptions on that,
  if it is caught, gets handed the current ``message`` in a ``run`` method, so you
  can do custom behaviours.

* Calling ``Channel.send`` or ``Group.send`` from outside a consumer context
  (i.e. in tests or management commands) will once again send the message immediately,
  rather than putting it into the consumer message buffer to be flushed when the
  consumer ends (which never happens)

* The base implementation of databinding now correctly only calls ``group_names(instance)``,
  as documented.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
