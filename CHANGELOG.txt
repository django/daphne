2.5.0 (2020-04-15)
------------------

* Fixes compatability for twisted when running Python 3.8+ on Windows, by 
  setting ``asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy`` as the event loop policy 
  in this case. 

* The internal ``daphne.testing.TestApplication`` now requires an addition 
  ``lock`` argument to ``__init__()``. This is expected to be an instance of 
  ``multiprocessing.Lock``.

2.4.1 (2019-12-18)
------------------

* Avoids Twisted using the default event loop, for compatibility with Django
  3.0's ``async_unsafe()`` decorator in threaded contexts, such as using the
  auto-reloader.

2.4.0 (2019-11-20)
------------------

* Adds CI testing against and support for Python 3.8.

* Adds support for ``raw_path`` in ASGI scope.

* Ensures an error response is sent to the client if the application sends
  malformed headers.

* Resolves an asyncio + multiprocessing problem when testing that would cause
  the test suite to fail/hang on macOS.

* Requires installing Twisted's TLS extras, via ``install_requires``.

* Adds missing LICENSE to distribution.

2.3.0 (2019-04-09)
------------------

* Added support for ASGI v3.

2.2.5 (2019-01-31)
------------------

* WebSocket handshakes are now affected by the websocket connect timeout, so
  you can limit them from the command line.

* Server name can now be set using --server-name


2.2.4 (2018-12-15)
------------------

* No longer listens on port 8000 when a file descriptor is provided with --fd

* Fixed a memory leak with WebSockets


2.2.3 (2018-11-06)
------------------

* Enforce that response headers are only bytestrings, rather than allowing
  unicode strings and coercing them into bytes.

* New command-line options to set proxy header names: --proxy-headers-host and
  --proxy-headers-port.


2.2.2 (2018-08-16)
------------------

* X-Forwarded-Proto support is now present and enabled if you turn on the
  --proxy-headers flag

* ASGI applications are no longer instantiated in a thread (the ASGI spec
  was finalised to say all constructors must be non-blocking on the main thread)


2.2.1 (2018-07-22)
------------------

* Python 3.7 compatability is flagged and ensured by using Twisted 18.7 and
  above as a dependency.

* The send() awaitable in applications no longer blocks if the connection is
  closed.

* Fixed a race condition where applications would be cleaned up before they
  had even started.


2.2.0 (2018-06-13)
------------------

* HTTP timeouts have been removed by default, as they were only needed
  with ASGI/Channels 1. You can re-enable them with the --http-timeout
  argument to Daphne.

* Occasional errors on application timeout for non-fully-opened sockets
  and for trying to read closed requests under high load are fixed.

* X-Forwarded-For headers are now correctly decoded in all environments
  and no longer have unicode matching issues.


2.1.2 (2018-05-24)
------------------

* Fixed spurious errors caused by websockets disconnecting before their
  application was instantiated.

* Stronger checking for type-safety of headers as bytestrings


2.1.1 (2018-04-18)
------------------

* ASGI application constructors are now run in a threadpool as they might
  contain blocking synchronous code.


2.1.0 (2018-03-05)
------------------

* Removed subprotocol support from server, as it never really worked. Subprotocols
  can instead be negotiated by ASGI applications now.

* Non-ASCII query strings now raise a 400 Bad Request error rather than silently
  breaking the logger


2.0.4 (2018-02-21)
------------------

* Ping timeouts no longer reset on outgoing data, only incoming data

* No more errors when connections close prematurely


2.0.3 (2018-02-07)
------------------

* Unix socket listening no longer errors during startup (introduced in 2.0.2)

* ASGI Applications are now not immediately killed on disconnection but instead
  given --application-close-timeout seconds to exit (defaults to 10)


2.0.2 (2018-02-04)
------------------

* WebSockets are no longer closed after the duration of http_timeout


2.0.1 (2018-02-03)
------------------

* Updated logging to correctly route exceptions through the main Daphne logger


2.0.0 (2018-02-01)
------------------

* Major rewrite to the new async-based ASGI specification and to support
  Channels 2. Not backwards compatible.


1.3.0 (2017-06-16)
------------------

* Ability to set the websocket connection timeout

* Server no longer reveals the exact Autobahn version number for security

* A few unicode fixes for Python 2/3 compatability

* Stopped logging messages to already-closed connections as ERROR


1.2.0 (2017-04-01)
------------------

* The new process-specific channel support is now implemented, resulting in
  significantly less traffic to your channel backend.

* Native twisted blocking support for channel layers that support it is now
  used. While it is a lot more efficient, it is also sometimes slightly more
  latent; you can disable it using --force-sync.

* Native SSL termination is now correctly reflected in the ASGI-HTTP `scheme`
  key.

* accept: False is now a valid way to deny a connection, as well as close: True.

* HTTP version is now correctly sent as one of "1.0", "1.1" or "2".

* More command line options for websocket timeouts


1.1.0 (2017-03-18)
------------------

* HTTP/2 termination is now supported natively. The Twisted dependency has been
  increased to at least 17.1 as a result; for more information about setting up
  HTTP/2, see the README.

* X-Forwarded-For decoding support understands IPv6 addresses, and picks the
  most remote (leftmost) entry if there are multiple relay hosts.

* Fixed an error where `disconnect` messages would still try and get sent even
  if the client never finished a request.


1.0.3 (2017-02-12)
------------------

* IPv6 addresses are correctly accepted as bind targets on the command line

* Twisted 17.1 compatability fixes for WebSocket receiving/keepalive and
  proxy header detection.


1.0.2 (2017-02-01)
------------------

* The "null" WebSocket origin (including file:// and no value) is now accepted
  by Daphne and passed onto the application to accept/deny.

* Listening on file descriptors works properly again.

* The DeprecationError caused by not passing endpoints into a Server class
  directly is now a warning instead.


1.0.1 (2017-01-09)
------------------

* Endpoint unicode strings now work correctly on Python 2 and Python 3


1.0.0 (2017-01-08)
------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE: Daphne now requires acceptance of WebSocket connections
  before it finishes the socket handshake and relays incoming packets.
  You must upgrade to at least Channels 1.0.0 as well; see
  http://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/1.0.0.html for more.

* http.disconnect now has a `path` key

* WebSockets can now be closed with a specific code

* X-Forwarded-For header support; defaults to X-Forwarded-For, override with
  --proxy-headers on the commandline.

* Twisted endpoint description string support with `-e` on the command line
  (allowing for SNI/ACME support, among other things)

* Logging/error verbosity fixes and access log flushes properly


0.15.0 (2016-08-28)
-------------------

* Connections now force-close themselves after pings fail for a certain
  timeframe, controllable via the new --ping-timeout option.

* Badly-formatted websocket response messages now log to console in
  all situations

* Compatability with Twisted 16.3 and up


0.14.3 (2016-07-21)
-------------------

* File descriptors can now be passed on the commandline for process managers
  that pass sockets along like this.

* websocket.disconnect messages now come with a "code" attribute matching the
  WebSocket spec.

* A memory leak in request logging has been fixed.


0.14.2 (2016-07-07)
-------------------

* Marked as incompatible with twisted 16.3 and above until we work out why
  it stops incoming websocket messages working


0.14.1 (2016-07-06)
-------------------

* Consumption of websocket.receive is also now required.


0.14.0 (2016-07-06)
-------------------

* Consumption of websocket.connect is now required (channels 0.16 enforces
  this); getting backpressure on it now results in the socket being
  force closed.


0.13.1 (2016-06-28)
-------------------

* Bad WebSocket handshakes now return 400 and an error messages
  rather than 500 with no content.


0.13.0 (2016-06-22)
-------------------

* Query strings are now sent as bytestrings and the application is responsible
  for decoding. Ensure you're running Channels 0.15 or higher.


0.12.2 (2016-06-21)
-------------------

* Plus signs in query string are now handled by Daphne, not Django-by-mistake.
  Ensure you're running Channels 0.14.3 or higher.

* New --root-path and DAPHNE_ROOT_PATH options for setting root path.


0.12.1 (2016-05-18)
-------------------

* Fixed bug where a non-ASCII byte in URL paths would crash the HTTP parser
  without a response; now returns 400, and hardening in place to catch most
  other errors and return a 500.

* WebSocket header format now matches HTTP header format and the ASGI spec.
  No update needed to channels library, but user code may need updating.


0.12.0 (2016-05-07)
-------------------

* Backpressure on http.request now causes incoming requests to drop with 503.
  Websockets will drop connection/disconnection messages/received frames if
  backpressure is encountered; options are coming soon to instead drop the
  connection if this happens.


0.11.4 (2016-05-04)
-------------------

* Don't try to send TCP host info in message for unix sockets


0.11.3 (2016-04-27)
-------------------

* Don't decode + as a space in URLs


0.11.2 (2016-04-27)
-------------------

* Correctly encode all path params for WebSockets


0.11.1 (2016-04-26)
-------------------

* Fix bugs with WebSocket path parsing under Python 2


0.11.0 (2016-04-26)
-------------------

* HTTP paths and query strings are now pre-decoded before going to ASGI

-------------------

* Error on badly formatted websocket reply messages

-------------------

* WebSockets now close after they've been open for longer than the channel
  layer group expiry (86400 seconds by default for most layers).

* Binding to UNIX sockets is now possible (use the -u argument)

* WebSockets now send keepalive pings if they've had no data for a certain
  amount of time (20 seconds by default, set with --ping-interval)


0.10.0 (2016-03-21)
-------------------

* Multiple cookies are now set correctly

* Follows new ASGI single-response-channel spec for !

* Follows new ASGI header encoding spec for HTTP


0.9.3 (2016-03-08)
------------------

* WebSocket query strings are correctly encoded


0.9.2 (2016-03-02)
------------------

* HTTP requests now time out after a configurable amount of time and return 503
  (default is 2 minutes)


0.9.1 (2016-03-01)
------------------

* Main thread actually idles rather than sitting at 100%

* WebSocket packets have an "order" attribute attached

* WebSocket upgrade header detection is now case insensitive


0.9 (2016-02-21)
----------------

* Signal handlers can now be disabled if you want to run inside a thread
  (e.g. inside Django autoreloader)
