Please submit **questions** about usage to django-users@googlegroups.com (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users) and about development to django-developers@googlegroups.com (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-developers).

If you're submitting a feature request, please try to include:

- Detailed description of the overall behaviour
- Reasoning why it should be in Channels rather than a third-party app
- Examples of usage, if possible (it's easier to discuss concrete code examples)

If you're submitting a bug report, please include:

- Your OS and runtime environment, and browser if applicable
- The versions of Channels, Daphne, Django, Twisted, and your ASGI backend (asgi_ipc or asgi_redis normally)
- What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
- How you're running Channels (runserver? daphne/runworker? Nginx/Apache in front?)
- Console logs and full tracebacks of any errors
