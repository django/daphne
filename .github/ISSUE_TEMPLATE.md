Issues are for **concrete, actionable bugs and feature requests** only - if you're just asking for debugging help or technical support we have to direct you elsewhere. If you just have questions or support requests please use:

- Stack Overflow
- The Django Users mailing list django-users@googlegroups.com (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users)

We have to limit this because of limited volunteer time to respond to issues!

Please also try and include, if you can:

- Your OS and runtime environment, and browser if applicable
- A `pip freeze` output showing your package versions
- What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
- How you're running Channels (runserver? daphne/runworker? Nginx/Apache in front?)
- Console logs and full tracebacks of any errors
